### Hi there, I'm Paul! ðŸ‘‹

I am a forward-thinking software engineer with a strong focus on leveraging AI technologies like Chat GPT models to create innovative chatbots and productivity tools, particularly in the realm of job searching. My expertise lies in developing scalable, high-performance web applications using React, React Native, JavaScript and TypeScript. I have a keen interest in exploring how AI will revolutionize software development, and I continuously upskill in this area.

My technical proficiency extends to Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy, ensuring a versatile and robust backend support for my front-end endeavors. My ability to communicate effectively and collaborate with both technical and non-technical team members has been a cornerstone of my professional success.

My skill set includes a strong foundation in essential soft skills like communication and collaboration.
