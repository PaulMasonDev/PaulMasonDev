### Hi there, I'm Paul! ðŸ‘‹

Passionate web developer who gets excited about creating new applications that
tap into the power of public APIs and data. With the careful use of asynchronous
javascript and by creating responsive front-end interfaces, I am able to display the
most important pieces of information for the client's needs. I love to see projects
grow from tiny seedlings of thought to fully functional productivity applications that
users can immediately benefit from. While continuing to build applications, I also
seek out opportunities to collaborate with other like minded developers in order to
hone in on my craft. I have experience with Scrum Agile methodologies and Git and
Github version control.
